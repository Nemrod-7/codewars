brnfk :

case '>': increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right)
case '<': decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
case '+': increment (increase by one, truncate overflow: 255 + 1 = 0) the byte at the data pointer
case '-': decrement (decrease by one, treat as unsigned byte: 0 - 1 = 255 ) the byte at the data pointer.
case '.': output the byte at the data pointer.
case ',': store one byte of input to the data pointer.
case '[': until data pointer != 0, loop then jump to command after ]
case ']': until data pointer != 0, got to command after [

brnfk algorithms :

To make no assumption about the initial cell value, use: [-]
Read all characters into memory: ,[>,]

add a + b : [>-<+]<.
